Natural Language Processing (NLP) has existed for about 50 years, but it is more relevant than ever. There have been several breakthroughs in this branch of machine learning that is concerned with spoken and written language. For example, learning internal representations of words was one of the greater advances of the last decade. Word embeddings (@Mikolov2013, @Bojanowski2016) made it possible and allowed developers to encode words as dense vectors that capture their underlying semantic content. In this way, similar words are embedded close to each other in a lower-dimensional feature space. Another important challenge was solved by Encoder-decoder (also called sequence-to-sequence) architectures @Sutskever2014, which made it possible to map input sequences to output sequences of different lengths. They are especially useful for complex tasks like machine translation, video captioning or question answering. This approach makes minimal assumptions on the sequence structure and can deal with different word orders and active, as well as passive voice.


A definitely significant state-of-the-art technique is Attention @Bahdanau2014, which enables models to actively shift their focus – just like humans do. It allows following one thought at a time while suppressing information irrelevant to the task. As a consequence, it has been shown to significantly improve performance for tasks like machine translation. By giving the decoder access to directly look at the source, the bottleneck is avoided and at the same time, it provides a shortcut to faraway states and thus helps with the vanishing gradient problem. One of the most recent sequence data modeling techniques is Transformers (@vaswani2017attention), which are solely based on attention and do not have to process the input data sequentially (like RNNs). Therefore, the deep learning model is better in remembering context-induced earlier in long sequences. It is the dominant paradigm in NLP currently and even makes better use of GPUs, because it can perform parallel operations. Transformer architectures like BERT (@Devlin2018), T5 (@Raffel2019) or GPT-3 (@brown2020language) are pre-trained on a large corpus and can be fine-tuned for specific language tasks. They have the capability to generate stories, poems, code and much more. With the help of the aforementioned breakthroughs, deep networks have been successful in retrieving information and finding representations of semantics in the modality text. In the next paragraphs, developments for another modality image are going to be presented.

Computer vision (CV) focuses on replicating parts of the complexity of the human visual system and enabling computers to identify and process objects in images and videos in the same way that humans do. In recent years it has become one of the main and widely applied fields of computer science. However, there are still problems that are current research topics, whose solutions depend on the research's view on the topic. One of the problems is how to optimize deep convolutional neural networks for image classification. The accuracy of classification depends on width, depth and image resolution. One way to address the degradation of training accuracy is by introducing a deep residual learning framework [@ResNet]. On the other hand, another less common method is to scale up ConvNets, to achieve better accuracy is by scaling up image resolution. Based on this observation, there was proposed a simple yet effective compound scaling method, called EfficientNets [@EfficientNet].

Another state-of-the-art trend in computer vision is learning effective visual representations without human supervision. Discriminative approaches based on contrastive learning in the latent space have recently shown great promise, achieving state-of-the-art results, but the simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations, which is called SimCLR, outperforms previous work [@SimCLR]. However, another research proposes as an alternative a simple “swapped” prediction problem where we predict the code of a view from the representation of another view. Where features are learned by Swapping Assignments between multiple Views of the same image (SwAV) [@SwAV].
Further recent contrastive methods are trained by reducing the distance between representations of different augmented views of the same image (‘positive pairs’) and increasing the distance between representations of augmented views from different images (‘negative pairs’). Bootstrap Your Own Latent (BYOL) is a new algorithm for self-supervised learning of image representatios [@BYOL].

Self-attention-based architectures, in particular, Transformers have become the model of choice in natural language processing (NLP). Inspired by NLP successes, multiple works try combining CNN-like architectures with self-attention, some replacing the convolutions entirely. The latter models, while theoretically efficient, have not yet been scaled effectively on modern hardware accelerators due to the use of specialized attention patterns. Inspired by the Transformer scaling successes in NLP, one of the experiments is applying a standard Transformer directly to the image [@ImageT]. Due to the widespread application of computer vision, these problems differ and are constantly being at the center of attention of more and more research.


With the rapid development in NLP and CV in recent years, it was just a question of time to merge both modalities to tackle multi-modal tasks. The release of DALL-E 2 just hints at what one can expect from this merge in the future. DALL-E 2 is able to create photorealistic images or even art from any given text input. So it takes the information of one modality and turns it into another modality. It needs multi-modal datasets to make this possible, which are still relatively rare. This shows the importance of available data and the ability to use it even more. Nevertheless, all modalities are in need of huge datasets to pre-train their models. It's common to pre-train a model and fine-tune it afterwards for a specific task on another dataset. For example, every state-of-the-art CV model uses a classifier pre-trained on an ImageNet based dataset. The cardinality of the datasets used for CV is immense, but the datasets used for NLP are of a completely different magnitude. BERT uses the English Wikipedia and the Bookscorpus to pre-train the model. The latter consists of almost 1 billion words and 74 million sentences. The pre-training of GPT-3 is composed of five huge corpora: CommonCrawl, Books1 and Books2, Wikipedia and WebText2. Unlike language model pre-training that can leverage tremendous natural language data, vision-language tasks require high-quality image descriptions that are hard to obtain for free. Widely used pre-training datasets for VL-PTM are Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO), Visual Genome (VG), Conceptual Captions (CC), Flickr30k, LAION-400M and LAION-5B, which is now the biggest openly accessible image-text dataset.


Besides the importance of pre-training data, there must also be a way to test or compare the different models. A reasonable approach is to compare the performance on specific tasks, which is called benchmarking. A nice feature of benchmarks is that they allow us to compare the models to a human baseline. Different metrics are used to compare the performance of the models. Accuracy is widely used, but there are also some others. For CV the most common benchmark datasets are ImageNet, ImageNetReaL, CIFAR-10(0), OXFORD-IIIT PET, OXFORD Flower 102, COCO and Visual Task Adaptation Benchmark (VTAB). The most common benchmarks for NLP are General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE), SuperGLUE, SQuAD 1.1, SQuAD 2.0, SWAG, RACE, ReCoRD, and CoNLL-2003. VTAB, GLUE and SuperGLUE also provide a public leader board. Cross-modal tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA), Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), Natural Language Visual Reasoning (NLVR), Flickr30K, COCO and Visual Entailment are common benchmarks for VL-PTM.
